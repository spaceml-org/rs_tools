# Fidelity Checks

Here we are developing basic fidelity checks for ITI data.

1. Field of Gaussian sources that vairy in intensity, size and position-angle.
1. Same field but in field of non-uniform noise.
1. Sharp-edged structures that vairy in intensity, size, aspect ratio and PA.
1. Same field but with non-uniform noise.
1. Pure noise field that varies on different length scales.
